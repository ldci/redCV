we don't need to prefix matrix methods by self" - true, I removed `self/` (there was one conflict, but it is resolved now).
" we have to decide which methods modify the mx object and which methods create a new mx object" - Currently: 
1) like in case of vector!, scalar operations are modifying, and ops involving two matrices create new one
2) modifying methods: _setAt _swapDim _matScalarOp _matRREF _changeData setAt removeRow removeCol insertRow appendRow insertCol appendCol augment split switchRows rowAdd rowProduct transpose negative rotate rotateRow rotateCol scalarAddition scalarSubtraction scalarProduct scalarDivision scalarRemainder scalarAnd scalarOr scalarXor scalarRightShift scalarLeftShift scalarRightShiftUnsigned
methods creating new matrix: _matOp create init scalar (identity zero) invert addition subtraction standardProduct HadamardProduct KroneckerProduct division getIdentity
