# Computer Vision with Red Language 
## see http://www.red-lang.org 
### This library needs View 


For Windows and macOS. 
Due to the excellent work of Regis 
Available for Linux now with GTK backend.

### You need the lastest Red master version.

Developped under macOS 10.14

Tested with macOS, Windows XP and Windows 10.

You must compile samples since red routines are required.

Use first -u compiler option to create a Red RT library and then just -c option which makes the compilation faster:

*red -u -c FileName -> creates a specific LibRT*

*then just red -c FileName -> Faster compilation*

Integral for matrices and images are added.

See RedCV manual for details.


### NEW NOVEMNBER 12 2016

WARNING: some exe are reported with "TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen2" infection by Github.

Puzzling since exe are compiled under MacOS, but to avoid any problems all exe are suppressed.

red -c -t Windows filename.red

Very easy to do :)

Statistical functions improved. See RedCV_Manual documentation for details.

### NEW OCTOBER 14 2016

New samples in /samples/Draw_DSL/ 

This is an illustration of how Draw DSL can be used to create nice graphical applications.

Enjoy 


### NEW OCTOBER 10 2016

### NEW: July 8 2106
A lot of work for this new version with faster routines and functions

Most of functions are in the form rcvFunction [src [image!] dst [image!]] [....]
This avoids memory leaks due to image copy 

New organizations for libs 

All Red/System Routines are in the same file and routines are exported as red functions in the various libs

New basic samples (to be compiled) 

Documentation and new samples will be included ASAP


### NEW: June 28 2016

/samples for red code
/samples/_exe for exec files


### NEW: June 17 2016

Convolution routines for images are added.

More to come ...


### NEW: June 15 2016
Added statistical functions on image.

Added some space color conversion.

More to come...


### NEW: June 2016
After playing a long time with OpenCV and Red language, it's time for me to write some image processing functions directly with Red:)

Conversions, logical and some math operators for images are available.


According to KISS spirit of Red, you only need  to include one file in your code : #include %libs/redcv.red.(See opimage.red sample for detail).

This file includes Red Functions and calls all necessary routines. 

More functions and samples to come!

You'll find some images to play within images folder. All supported images by Red can be used.

Special thanks to Nenad for developing Red, and to Qingtian for image implementation.


##Please feel free to contribute and enjoy :)
