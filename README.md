### NEW: June 2016
After playing a long time with OpenCV and Red language, it's time for me to write some image processing functions directly with Red:)

Conversions, logical and some math operators for images are available.


According to KISS spirit of Red, you only need  to include one file in your code : #include %libs/redcv.red.(See opimage.red sample for detail).

This file includes Red Functions and calls all necessary routines. 

More functions and samples to come!

You'll find some images to play within images folder. All supported images by Red can be used.

Special thanks to Nenad for developing Red, and to Qingtian for image implementation.
