Red 0.6.5 built macOS  15-Jan-2025/8:57:02+01:00  commit #498cc9d (redc) including nodes-cg branch into master-branch.99,61% of code samples are correct in developer or release mode. But, in some examples, I had to deactivate the GC (with recycle/off).So I'm waiting for Red Team fixes for memory allocation.
